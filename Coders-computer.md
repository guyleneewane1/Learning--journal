# Linux

## Basic Navigation

 - **ls**  which is short for list
 -  A **Shell** is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running

 ### Absolute and Relative Paths
 
 -There are 2 types of **paths** we can use, absolute and relative. 
  **Absolute paths** specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )

**Relative paths** specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
